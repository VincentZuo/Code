In terms of the perspective of its reception, the characterization of\\nscience and its system must, to many, initially seem to consist solely in the\\npredicates just enumerated, namely, the pure content, the basis and subject,\\nthe non-self-consciousness of the actual essence as concept, and, to sum it all\\nup, the pure necessity of its moments. It is this first aspect that presents\\nitself and that is indeed the first thing which universally ensnares the in-\\nterest of speculation. However, only when the movement is followed and\\nits necessity grasped does the nature of what this enterprise is really about\\nemerge. For each of those predicates say only in a one-sided manner what\\nis contained in them as a result, or, each of those marks designates only\\none determination of the absolute. Therein is that mark only one side, just\\nas that result itself is likewise one of the moments that is the whole. The\\ndetermination of the movement is indeed only that movement itself when\\nit is this in truth that expresses the absolute in the latter, and that moves\\nfrom its beginning to its end; or, when it has articulation within itself, and\\nwhen these moments, which the beginning puts into motion, must be gravi-\\ntating around each other and only count as essential to science by virtue of\\nthis; or, when these moments neither exist for themselves as self-subsisting\\nones, nor in themselves have being. Hence, these different aspects are all\\nof them inadequate in expressing what was their viewpoint only in a one-\\nsided aspect, or they all express what is only a momentary expression of the\\nwhole. The result, by contrast, is the whole itself. It is the nature of the con-\\ncept to have its determining nature itself presented in the form of move-\\nment and to be for itself actuality. However different aspects may be in\\nthemselves moments of the concept, still the expression of determinate\\naspects, taken as what is self-subsisting, and which fixes itself in this self-\\nsubsisting unchangeableness, is the opposite of the concept. They are, as a\\nresult, no longer what characterizes science and its system. 207. The science now being sought could thus be characterized2 in such\\na way through these determinations but cannot be so characterized. In'"
